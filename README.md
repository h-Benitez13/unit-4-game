# unit-4-game
As you may have guessed it...I did not do a crystal collector theme

Reason: Stephen Hillenburg died during this assignments hw week, thought it'd be nostalgic (OH IT WAS)

Instructions: 

1. As the webpage loads the game begins by dsipalying the instructions for how and why this game is so challenging

2. The user's goal is to be able to match the score set for them by pressing the different patty images,
what the players dont know (or have not read yet) is the patty's have different values every new game.

3. The match score is between 19-120, randomized and always displays at the beginning of the game.

4. The values for the krabby patties are from 1-12, and randomized at the beginning of the game. 

5. In the event the user wins (matches the score), they receive an alert at the top of the page basically saying
"you win!" and the box underneath the krabby patty images increases by 1. It will be labelled as "Championship rings= ".

6. However, if the user has not been able to match the score, the player will receive an alert at the top apologizing for the 
horrendous loss they've received but wanting them to continue! At the bottom, below the krabby patty images
the box labelled "Sad faces= " will increase by 1, indicating the player has lost. 

The game is fairly simple to player (user side) and nostalgic at the same time!
